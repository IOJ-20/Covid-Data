- First step; import the data to be used and viewed (A CSV File)

- Third step (data transformation); check for null values and the respective sum of the null values
- Fourth step; check for all the columns on the table to ascertain that they are properly spelt with zero errors
- Fifth step; insert a new column called "Year" (values were not inserted. So we have the column header alone) and placed it in the first position which is zero (0) in Python
- Sixth step; extract the year from the data in the "Month" column and assign to a new variable name
- Seventh step; move the extracted years into the empty "Year" column with the exact year and month still intact in the "Month" column
- Eighth step; creat a summary of the data set by grouping the existing data set by Year
